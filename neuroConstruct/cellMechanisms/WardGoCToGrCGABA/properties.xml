Properties associated with the Cell Mechanism which allow it to be loaded into neuroConstruct.

Note the following: 
   The Cell Mechanism name should not contain spaces and should match the name of the directory it's in
   The name and description here will be replaced by the corresponding values in a ChannelML file if found
   The filenames for the mappings are relative to the cellMechanism/(cellMechInstanceName) directory
   Mechanism Type should only have values: Channel mechanism, Synaptic mechanism, Ion concentration, Point process, Gap junction

<entry key="Description">
    GABAR-mediated synapse between cerebellar Golgi and granule
    cell as described in Ward, D. R. Golgi cell mediated
    inhibition in the cerebellar granule cell layer. PhD thesis,
    University College London, 2012. Average over direct and
    spillover-only connections.

    Note that, because of how the STP model is defined, the
    'gbase' parameter corresponds to the experimentally measured
    'amplitude' divided by 'initReleaseProb'
    (0.3944nS=0.27nS/0.6846).
